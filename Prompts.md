## Kickoff
With your guidance, I'd like to build a personal homepage using HTML and CSS.
Please note that I'll only request specific code snippets as we progress,
so there's no need to provide code until I explicitly ask for it.
Are you ready to start?

## HTML Structure
Help me design a basic HTML structure for a personal homepage.
It should have the following section: a header, a section for displaying my projects, an about section, and a section for showcasing my skills. Also, include a footer.

Please add these sections as placeholders for now, as we will be coding them and filling them out step by step.

## Header and Navigation 
Please code an HTML header displaying my name, "Sanjeev Raghuwanshi," and navigation links for the sections: projects, about, and skills.

## About Section
Now guide me to create the HTML for the about section. It should include my picture, a friendly introduction, and a link to my resume.

## Skills Section
Now let's code the HTML for my skills section.

Let's start with the Basic skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.and Advance Skills are Joomla, WordPress, Core PHP, React, MySQL, jQuery organize according your best way.
Each skill should have a name and a description. I also want to display a progress bar representing my proficiency in each skill.

## Footer
Create the HTML content for footer section of the page. It should contain the copyright information and social media links for linkedin, twitter, instagram and facebook profile. Please use fonts icons for social media links.

## CSS Layout and Design
Next, design a simple modern CSS layout for my homepage.
The layout should be responsive to different screen size using CSS media queries.

I prefer a black and white color scheme and sans-serif fonts.

Make my picture smaller and rounded. Please add generous line height and visual space around the content.

## Site containers
Please suggest how to create containers for my site's content. Here is an example of a section of my page where I want a '.container' class only to control the width and alignment of the "About" content:

...
<section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
        <img src="photo.png" alt="My picture">
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        </div>
</section>
